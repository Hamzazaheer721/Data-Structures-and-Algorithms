- Big O

1. What does better mean ?
   -> Faster
   -> Less memory intensive
   -> More readable

2. The problem with time.
   -> Different machines will show different results although margin will remain there but overall it can change.
   -> Same machine can even give different times
   -> For fast algos, speed measurements may not be precise enough.

   - --- Solution ---
   - Instead of time, we will calculate number of simple operations that algo calculates
